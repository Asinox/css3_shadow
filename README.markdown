= Welcome to CSS3 Drop Shadows

A web application to build nice CSS3 box shadows.


Contribute
-----------

Feel free to contribute to the code. I wrote this app to learn coffeescript so
I'm sure you can improve my code... To contribute, fork me and please make a
git branch. And as I did not have any tests for coffeescript (shame on me ;) be sure
to widely document all your methods.
